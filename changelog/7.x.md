- New way to patch & code regions, see https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/70 https://github.com/vvvv/VL-Language/issues/53 and https://github.com/vvvv/The-Gray-Book/pull/59
  
#### Changes
- The popup that shows when trying to edit a string that is too long has more options
- SolutionExplorer and DependencyExplorer now have distinct shortcuts
- The entries in the Quad menu have seen a cleanup
- Removed the Hamburger menu and made About and Settings ordinary HDE windows
- Backup folder is now accessible via Recent menu
- In dependencies menu, help patches are now one level down in an extra help foldout
- Cleanup of tooltip when hovering pins
- Inspector has special editors for files and directories
- [No longer add dependencies on paste inside of packages](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/automatic-dependencies-implementation-when-copying-nodes-between-documents-nightmare/24211)
- Adds options to ignore compile and runtime errors to exporter
  - New option to ignore errors at compile time. Defaults to false (was true when exported via UI). Set to true to allow export of patches containing errors.
  - New option to ignore unhandled exeptions at runtime. Defaults to false. Set to true if exceptions should only get logged.
  - Makes Platform setting advanced -> it was a bit confusing and is only needed in rare cases.
- Replaces Target OS with Runtime Identifier in exporter. Maps directly to `RuntimeIdentifier` of generated C# project. Defaults to current OS and CPU architecture.
- Log warning if package doesn't contain native assets for current runtime
- More fine grained control over C# direct import feature (import namespace, type, mix with existing forwarding mechanism ...)
- Adds `PinGroupEditModes` for better control how pin groups can be edited. Allows for example to disable the `Ctrl++` shortcut on a pin group.
- Closing the splash screen (via task bar, or Alt+F4) will also quit vvvv
- Loop regions have better memory management when used in mutable patches
- Code generator adds aggressive inlining attribute to small methods
- Adds logs for auto-backup and reload

#### Fixes
- Finders are now DPI aware
- Fixes Export button not visible in higher DPI scalings 
- Editing any text in the patch canvas is now handled natively by the UI
- Fixes crash in help browser in case package url / license url / repo url couldn't be parsed as an Url - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/system-runtime-assembly-on-win-11/24426)
- Trigger a regular build for referenced C# projects to get xml doc file generated
- Pins created by property accessor action (Ctrl+Shift+K) will keep name of pad (white spaces get preserved, same as in Ctrl+K)
- Fixes `ObsoleteAttribute` not working on process nodes written in C#
- Fixes x64 installer crashing on arm64
- Enum editors respect the `Browseable(false)` to hide certain entries in UI
- Modifications made to the model at runtime via the public `ISolution` API get recorded and applied later on the main thread at a moment when the UI is idle - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/pingroup-solution-update/24062/7)
- App Health no longer shows messages which can't be associated with any document. Gets rid of those empty entries, which when clicked upon did either nothing or navigated to unrelated definition canvases.
- No longer import compiler generated `<Clone>$` methods
- When selecting a different node definition, existing pins which would lead to a different resolve result will get deleted
- Fixes stateful region choice not available on factory generated nodes
- Fixes hang in case path to C# project contains commas - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/vvvv-tries-loading-patch-and-never-finishes/24029/2)
- Removes unconnected patch pins after drag operation - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/problem-when-dragging-keep-inbetween-loops/23743)
- Use base64 encoding in case strings contain invalid XML chars - [1](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/a-patch-can-be-destroyed-when-certain-bytes-are-stored-in-the-iobox/22219/6) [2](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/invalid-characters-iobox-string-exception/24007)
- App exporter UI now in sync with app.props file. Changing anything in the UI will write the file and changing the file will update the UI.

### Standard Libraries

#### New Nodes
- ApplicationVersion
- FPS
- OSC, OSCQuery, MIDI, Redis binding nodes...

#### Changes
- Executor has new option: Run as Admin
- `Format [String]` uses pin group and throws error (turns pink) in case the format string is invalid
- Path.Exists/FileExists/DirectoryExists no longer return stale result
  - Removes all state except for the FileInfo as other logic relies on its existence and didn't want to introduce new bugs.
  - Patches should no longer use this node inside a loop / on main loop.
- IVLPropertyInfo.GetValue/WithValue now takes any object - IVLTypeInfo.Properties works correctly for non-VL types - ObjectEditor works on any object, CreateInstance takes arguments
- Example patch showing how to retrieve all classes implementing a certain interface and subsequently instantiate it dynamically
- Adds pin `To Definition` to `ShowPatchOfNode`
- One Direct3D11 device per app, graphics resources can therefor be shared nicely between Skia and Stride. While it was possible to render Skia inside of Stride, one would hit a road block when that Skia graph was accessing GPU backed resources. For example https://forum.vvvv.org/t/skia-resize-prevents-layer-to-be-rendered-in-stride/20202. In this approach we register Stride as the primary device provider. Skia will test for that, and if present, use the existing device instead of creating its own (which was happing until now).

#### Fixes
- Range and Seed inputs of Random node are now optional
- Deleting a large number of UDPServers no longer takes ages
- Skia and Stride PerfMeters now uses same damping of fps value so the numbers are the same
- Fixes path not serializable for message pack
- Fixes a resource leak in VideoPlayer node 

#### Skia
- Adds `FromSharedHandle` for Skia which in turn is getting used by texture/mesh viewers
- Rendering should react to graphics device lost events (famous red cross on white background)

#### Stride
- Fixes crash when resizing Stride window and at the same time having a background thread creating device resources (like a camera). It resulted in "Device creation not yet supported for GameWindowRenderer".
- Fixes `GraphicsData` node not working correctly with mutable collections - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/tospread-lag/24367/9)
- Adds missing `InputKey*` implementations
- Fixes `TryDisposeSequence` not returning true if all elements where disposed. Fixes `TextureQueue` not removing all slices on clear.
- Fixes invalid usage of GPU command list in `VideoSourceToTexture`
- Fixes vvvv not loading patches with broken/missing shaders

#### ImGui
- Adds new `ImGuiInputTextFlags.ItemDeactivationReturnsTrue` for Input widgets
  - When set on input widgets they will bang when modified and deactivated.
  - Added same behavior to Drag widgets when tabbing into them. For Slider widgets this was already the default behavior. Basically this fixes an inconsistency in ImGui itself.
  - The `ObjectEditor` will use that behavior as default when spawing input widgets.
- `ObjectEditor` can deal with `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint` ...
- Fixes `ObjectEditor` not showing label of property of type `Optional<T>`
- Adds `Input (String Callback)` region
- Adds dockable windows to Stride backend (thanks @kopffarben)

#### Redis
- If not configured otherwise the client will try to reconnect indefinitely
- Adds `SyncAsync` and marks `Scan` as obsolete
