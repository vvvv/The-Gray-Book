- In dependencies menu, help patches are now one level down in an extra help foldout
- Cleanup of tooltip when hovering pins
- improved tooltips for several type: Rectangle, Channel and more  
- Inspector has special editors for files and directories
- Inspector: now shows State Output pin (wasn't shown as not part of a fragment)
- Inspector can now work with named properties:
    - `Type` can be changed with autocomplete
    - Default for UIs to offer a reset to default functionality,
    - Don't Serialize to make sure to only save relevant info
    - Refinements on Min and Max for UIs to restrict value range of sliders even of Vector types
    - Added `Description`, `Tags` and `Custom metadata` attribute sections, some of the attributes are related to Public Channels and Bindings (?)
- Inspector shows IOBox values
- [No longer add dependencies on paste inside of packages](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/automatic-dependencies-implementation-when-copying-nodes-between-documents-nightmare/24211)
- Adds options to ignore compile and runtime errors to exporter
  - New option to ignore errors at compile time. Defaults to false (was true when exported via UI). Set to true to allow export of patches containing errors.
  - New option to ignore unhandled exeptions at runtime. Defaults to false. Set to true if exceptions should only get logged.
  - Makes Platform setting advanced -> it was a bit confusing and is only needed in rare cases.
- Replaces Target OS with Runtime Identifier in exporter. Maps directly to `RuntimeIdentifier` of generated C# project. Defaults to current OS and CPU architecture.
- Log warning if package doesn't contain native assets for current runtime
- More fine grained control over C# direct import feature (import namespace, type, mix with existing forwarding mechanism ...)
- Adds `PinGroupEditModes` for better control how pin groups can be edited. Allows for example to disable the `Ctrl++` shortcut on a pin group.

- Adds support for C# record structs - they are now flagged as immutable and record serializer picks them up as well
- Compiler warns of Potentially Uninitialized Pads, which can be helpful to track down problems. Often can be ignored though.
- Adds Ctrl-1 as an alternative shortcut in Renderers (Skia and Stride) to navigate into patch.

#### Fixes

- Fixes Export button not visible in higher DPI scalings 
- Editing any text in the patch canvas is now handled natively by the UI
- Fixes crash in help browser in case package url / license url / repo url couldn't be parsed as an Url - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/system-runtime-assembly-on-win-11/24426)
- Trigger a regular build for referenced C# projects to get xml doc file generated

- Fixes `ObsoleteAttribute` not working on process nodes written in C#
- Fixes x64 installer crashing on arm64
- Enum editors respect the `Browseable(false)` to hide certain entries in UI
- Modifications made to the model at runtime via the public `ISolution` API get recorded and applied later on the main thread at a moment when the UI is idle - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/pingroup-solution-update/24062/7)

- Removes unconnected patch pins after drag operation - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/problem-when-dragging-keep-inbetween-loops/23743)
- Use base64 encoding in case strings contain invalid XML chars - [1](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/a-patch-can-be-destroyed-when-certain-bytes-are-stored-in-the-iobox/22219/6) [2](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/invalid-characters-iobox-string-exception/24007)
- App exporter UI now in sync with app.props file. Changing anything in the UI will write the file and changing the file will update the UI.

- Logs exceptions during patch startup to the system log 
- Fixes Helpbrowser not showing content when trying to access github via a throttled connection, much faster content indexing 
- Fixes Debug Window > Log that was removing empty lines from messages - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/the-log-window-does-not-take-line-breaks-into-account/24409), and message counter was missing the first repetition - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/logger-message-counter-misses-the-first-repetition/24214).
- Select (ByPath) now works with globally available anonymous channels, which guarantees that everthing feels like one. No hidden syncs needed between several Select (ByPath) nodes as they share the sub-channels.
- mainwindow: improves responsiveness when resizing window

### Standard Libraries

#### New Nodes
- ApplicationVersion
- FPS
- OSC, OSCQuery, MIDI, Redis binding nodes...
- Log (Channel) node: reports value changes and author to the Log
- DeNiro as known from vvvv beta + BezierFilter as known from the new transitions
- Adds a slim CastAs (that will never try to create a nice default value. on fail will give you the .Net default, which often is NULL or 0)
- adds NULL (OrDefault), which doesn't throw exceptions when T is a value type. handy if you want to avoid object creation, you can feed this into TraGetValue and other operations that let you specify a fallback default value

#### Changes
- Executor has new option: Run as Admin
- `Format [String]` uses pin group and throws error (turns pink) in case the format string is invalid
- Path.Exists/FileExists/DirectoryExists no longer return stale result
  - Removes all state except for the FileInfo as other logic relies on its existence and didn't want to introduce new bugs.
  - Patches should no longer use this node inside a loop / on main loop.
- IVLPropertyInfo.GetValue/WithValue now takes any object - IVLTypeInfo.Properties works correctly for non-VL types - ObjectEditor works on any object, CreateInstance takes arguments
- Example patch showing how to retrieve all classes implementing a certain interface and subsequently instantiate it dynamically
- Adds pin `To Definition` to `ShowPatchOfNode`
- One Direct3D11 device per app, graphics resources can therefor be shared nicely between Skia and Stride. While it was possible to render Skia inside of Stride, one would hit a road block when that Skia graph was accessing GPU backed resources. For example https://forum.vvvv.org/t/skia-resize-prevents-layer-to-be-rendered-in-stride/20202. In this approach we register Stride as the primary device provider. Skia will test for that, and if present, use the existing device instead of creating its own (which was happing until now).
- Serialization.Raw: Adds support for `ReadOnlyMemory<T>` and `ArraySegment<T>`
- Try Region has a Warn input. Let''s you easily create runtime warnings. So we have an easy workflow of turning exceptions into warnings

#### Fixes
- Range and Seed inputs of Random node are now optional
- Deleting a large number of UDPServers no longer takes ages
- Skia and Stride PerfMeters now uses same damping of fps value so the numbers are the same
- Fixes path not serializable for message pack
- Fixes a resource leak in VideoPlayer node
- Fixes memory leak in VideoPlayer when switching videos of different size
- VideoSourceTo* nodes use a dedicated background thread to ensure the amount of render contexts created per thread is kept to a minimum
- Fixes `ApplicationPath` when running on Linux/OSX with `dotnet ...`
- fixes BezierSegmentLength. thanks TremensS!
- fixed Tangent in ResampleBSpline (Tangent). Thanks Natan
- VL Type Reflection: "Indexer Properties" don't show up as Properties
- Fixes Send (Local) issue: when anonymously sending a NULL this gets ignored
- ObjectEditor (list, monadic) forwards components (e.g. attributes) to on-the-fly channels for inner editors.
- fix for WithValueByPath. Wasn't able to set a property that was NULL before

#### Skia
- Adds `FromSharedHandle` for Skia which in turn is getting used by texture/mesh viewers
- Rendering should react to graphics device lost events (famous red cross on white background)
- Fixes `GetFillPath` node naming
- Removes experimental `ParseSvgPathData` and `ToSvgPathData` (FromSVGPathData and ToSVGPathData should be used) 

#### Stride
- Breaking change: Collada files may not load correctly. This issue is tracked [here](https://github.com/stride3d/stride/issues/2516).
- Fixes crash when resizing Stride window and at the same time having a background thread creating device resources (like a camera). It resulted in "Device creation not yet supported for GameWindowRenderer".
- Fixes `GraphicsData` node not working correctly with mutable collections - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/tospread-lag/24367/9)
- Adds missing `InputKey*` implementations
- Fixes `TryDisposeSequence` not returning true if all elements where disposed. Fixes `TextureQueue` not removing all slices on clear.
- Fixes invalid usage of GPU command list in `VideoSourceToTexture`
- Fixes vvvv not loading patches with broken/missing shaders
- Adds `TextureToSkImage` node to turn a texture into a Skia image without blocking the GPU / without allocating every frame
- Fixes race condition when loading shaders leading to completely broken vvvv. This regression was introduced with 6.5: https://discourse.vvvv.org/t/shader-compiler-throws-error-when-referencing-file-via-include/22652/4
- Adds `Location` aka Gizmo for manipulating entities and controlling values, to be used in Edit Mode (F4). EditMode comes with Undo for those Gizmp changes and nice Size management of Gizmos. Those are always rendered on top and can get resized via Shift-Scroll

#### ImGui
- Adds new `ImGuiInputTextFlags.ItemDeactivationReturnsTrue` for Input widgets
  - When set on input widgets they will bang when modified and deactivated.
  - Added same behavior to Drag widgets when tabbing into them. For Slider widgets this was already the default behavior. Basically this fixes an inconsistency in ImGui itself.
  - The `ObjectEditor` will use that behavior as default when spawing input widgets.
- `ObjectEditor` can deal with `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint` ...
- Fixes `ObjectEditor` not showing label of property of type `Optional<T>`
- Adds `Input (String Callback)` region
- Adds dockable windows to Stride backend (thanks @kopffarben)
- fixes ImGui based windows not reacting on first click
- Adds `Custom Glyph Range` pin to the `FontConfig`, allows using icon-fonts and any glyph ranges.
- Adds `ImGuiSliderFlags` - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/imgui-slider-missing-flags/24035/2), `IsWindowDocked` - [forum](https://forum.vvvv.org/t/expose-imgui-iswindowdocked/24048)
- Adds `Input (Path)`, and advanced `Input (TimeSpan)` and `Drag (TimeSpan)`
- FIxes `SetIndentStyle` was not converting to hecto

#### Redis
- If not configured otherwise the client will try to reconnect indefinitely
- Adds `SyncAsync` and marks `Scan` as obsolete
- Fixes system not restoring client side tracking in multi-server setup
- Adds advanced `Get`, `GetAsync`, `Set`, `SetAsync` nodes to `RedisClient`
- Adds new pin `When` to `Binding` node allowing to control the condition under which the value is written to Redis
