# The User Interface

## Main Menu
There is no middleclick main menu in VL. Instead all main functions hide behind the little gray `Quad Menu` in the topleft corner. Next to the quad menu is the Document Menu with entries concerning the active document. See [Navigating a Project](../../hde/navigating_a_project.html).

## The NodeBrowser
The VL NodeBrowser is a totally different beast. See [The NodeBrowser](../../hde/the_nodebrowser.md).

## Inspector
There are two Inspectors: 
- The main [Inspector](../../hde/inspector.md)
- An Inspector can also be opened next to inspectable elements on demand. MiddleClick an Input/Output, Pad or IOBox or rightclick on its label -> Configure to bring up its Inspector.

## Finder
See [Finders](../../hde/finders.md).

## TTY Renderer
There is a convenient logging window which you an open via `Quad Menu` -> `Windows` -> `Log`. See also [Debugging](../../hde/debugging-log.md).

## Docking Patches
Patch windows and tool windows can be docked by simply dragging them in and out of other windows. See [settings](../../hde/settings.md) "Open previous documents/windows" to for options on restoring sessions.

## Open a nodes patch
Where in beta you'd rightclick a node to open its corresponding patch, in VL you rightclick -> Open. 

## Patching
Removing a link to a pin in vvvv beta would copy the current value into the pin. This is not happening in VL.
